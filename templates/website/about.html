                    <p class="lead">Indian Academy Of Robotics has a team of highly enthusiastic individuals working to redefine teaching. We believe “Knowledge alone is not enough: they must learn how to use their knowledge creatively” and therefore brings to you the traditional kindergarten approach to learning. Our program offers structured and hands – on technology based learning solutions to help students to bridge the gap between key theoretical concepts and their real world applications. Digital technologies can play a transformational role in learning and education. It helps to extend the kindergarten approach, so that learner of all ages can continue to learn in the kindergarten style. Robotics is an excellent multidisciplinary platform to impart practical, hands-on learning to children. Students develop scientific enquiry skills, which allow them to investigate, plan, test and implement their ideas, enabling them to reach their full potential. Students develop knowledge and skills vital for success in the 21st Century.</p>

						<h3>Vision</h3>
						<div class="tr-pa">V</div>
						<p>We believe that practical beats theory. we want to make students capable of crossing over the limits of knowlege from zero to infinite. they can
							grorw  on STEM(Science,technology, engineering, maths) platform where students can relate and
							 link their subjects practically..</p>
